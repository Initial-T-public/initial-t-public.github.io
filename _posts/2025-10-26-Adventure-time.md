It's the day after the annual switch to daylight saving time, so even though it's 23:30 (or 11:30 p.m. for those living in other parts of the world), it feels like it's already 24:30.

The last time I had a blog was when I was 12 years old, and I wrote about my dream cars. Now, 20 years later I've decided to start writing again because I'm considering changing my career path from software developer to something more akin to a pentester or red team member, or, you could say, a hacker. For the past 10 years, I've specialized in internet technologies, but lately, times have been tough for us for reasons we all know â€“ artificial intelligence and the end of venture capital funding for stupid ideas for web applications, favoring stupid ideas related to artificial intelligence.

I want to describe my journey here, also as the ultimate goal of which is to become a freelancer in the penetration testing industry. Also from time to time I'd like to post about something else from other my fields of interest.

However, I am extremely lazy and can only focus on things that interest my mind. I will try to post here not so much detailed explanations about CTF or instructions for using well-known tools, but rather the thoughts of a person with experience in programming who is learning to hack.
