I am a programmer with over 10 years of experience, and I am currently trying to achieve one of my other goals â€“ to learn how to hack. Computers have been with me my whole life, but I feel like I still have a lot to learn. This blog is dedicated to this journey of knowledge and the interesting things I have noticed along the way.
